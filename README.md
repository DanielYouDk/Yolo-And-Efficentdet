Click on the link below to access the TensorFlow model zoo page:
TensorFlow Model Zoo

Once on the TensorFlow model zoo page, find the section for "EfficientDet D5 1280x1280" model and download the corresponding folder.

After downloading the EfficientDet D5 model folder, make sure to note its name/location on your computer.

In the code file named "efficientdet5_coco17_object_detection," you need to update the command line parameter "--model" with the correct folder name of the EfficientDet D5 model you just downloaded. This will ensure that the code uses the correct model for the object detection.

Additionally, there is another link to download pretrained weights used to train the YOLO Model. Click on the link below to download the file:
Pretrained YOLO Model Weights

Once downloaded, place the pretrained YOLO model weights file in the "yolo-info" folder. This folder is likely referenced in the code for loading the YOLO Model.

Before running the code, make sure to read the instructions provided at the top of each code file to understand how to execute the code properly.
